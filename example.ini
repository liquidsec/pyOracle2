# Specify the IV mode

# In most implementations, the IV is provided as the 'first block' of the ciphertext. 
# In other cases, the IV may be kept a known secret by both endpoints. In such a case, it should still be possible to decrypt everything but the first block.
# The IV may also be a static values such as all zeroes.


# Modes: 

# 'firstblock'. This mode assumes that the first block of the ciphertext is the IV (most common)
# 'knownIV'. This mode allows for user provided IV
# 'unknown'. Use this mode when you do not know the IV and it is not the first block but still wish to decrypt all but the first block, or re-encrypt all but the first block for encryption
# 'lastblock'. This has not been implemented yet, but it may be in the future as it is a rare but possible configuration


# choose from one of the above modes
ivMode = firstblock
# If using knownIV mode, specify the IV
#IV should be in decimal list format. For example: [72,65,82,65,77,66,69]
iv =  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

# The oracle defines the information leak that is abused to know when padding is valid. This is typically an error message.
# There are several trigger modes depending on the situation. Sometimes you will want to look for a specific phrase, other times you want to look for an absence of that phrase. 

# trigger modes:
# 'search' - simply look for a specific phrase
# 'negative' - the opposite of search. Trigger when you don't see the phrase
oracleMode = negative

# Define the search phrase to look for from the oracle
